It is crucial that in this scenario, action be taken to try and prevent any possible deaths. If you were able to determine a potential attack vector, someone else could too, and they could have malicious intentions. Anyone looking to make the company look bad, cause general havoc, or even assassinate someone could hypothetically exploit this vulnerability. The first thing you ought to do would be to go to your boss and tell them about the possible exploit. Although they might be willing to look further into this, there is unfortunately the possibility that they, or their boss, or their boss's boss, could determine that the risk is not high enough to permit the cost associated with fixing the vulnerability. Perhaps no one else will find this security vulnerability, in which case, as long as the problem is kept quiet, nothing need be done. However, this vein of thinking is ultimately focused more on the company's bottom line than the possible lives that could be endangered. In this day and age, any large automotive manufacturer should expect to be the subject of attacks by a variety of actors, and although the best case scenario hypothesizes that nothing will come of this vulnerability, the worst case scenario results in numerous deaths, a severely damaged reputation for the company, and quite a bit of money spent on lawsuits, fines, PR, and lost revenue. If ethics is not enough to convince the company that action must be taken, the potential financial and reputational ramifications might do it. However, if the company determines it is willing to take the risk, then it is time to look outwards. Although this could put your job at risk, speaking to a consumer watchdog or some other government agency would be the next step. A consumer watchdog might be able to strong arm the company into taking action. Going to the public would be the last possible option, as making the vulnerability known to consumers also makes it known to attackers and could endanger anyone already driving a car with the compromised ECU, and no to mention, would open you up to lawsuits by the company. There are multiple paths to be taken at this point, but as a developer, there is an ethical imperative to do something about this security vulnerability no matter what.
